# 🎥 VideoSTF: An Evaluation Benchmark for Stress-Testing Output Repetition in Video Large Language Models

VideoSTF is the first benchmark for systematically measuring and stress-testing output repetition in Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs).

VideoSTF evaluates repetition using three complementary n-gram-based metrics (Repetition Rate, Repetition Intensity and Information Entropy) and provides a standardized, extensible testbed that covers diverse videos from public datasets, together with a library of controlled temporal transformations. VideoSTF currently supports three evaluations: Pervasive Testing, Temporal Stress Testing, and Adversarial Exploitation across 10 mainstream VideoLLMs.

## 📏 Metrics

VideoSTF reports three repetition metrics, computed over a set of $K$ model outputs.

### Repetition Rate (RR)
RR captures whether repetition occurs in an output. An output is marked as repetitive if it contains at least 1 repeated $n$-gram. Higher RR indicates repetition appears more frequently across outputs.

### Repetition Intensity (RI)
RI quantifies the extent of duplicated patterns. It uses the standard Rep-$n$ to measure the proportion of duplicated $n$-grams in each output. Higher RI indicates stronger repetitive patterns.

### Information Entropy (IE)
IE measures repetition through lexical diversity by capturing the diversity of $n$-grams. Lower entropy indicates lower lexical diversity and more severe repetition.

## 🎞️ Video Testbed

We construct a video testbed by randomly sampling videos from several publicly available video datasets:

- [LLaVA-Video-178K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmms-lab/LLaVA-Video-178K)
- [NeXT-QA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmms-lab/NExTQA)
- [ActivityNetQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmms-lab/ActivityNetQA)
- [LLaVA-Hound](https://huggingface.co/ShareGPTVideo/LLaVA-Hound-Pretrain)

The resulting collection exhibits substantial diversity in both temporal length and semantic content. Video durations range from short clips to moderately long videos, while the content spans a wide variety of everyday scenarios, with categories such as comedy, lifestyle, and sports appearing frequently.

## 🌀 Temporal Stressor Library

VideoSTF evaluates temporal robustness via a set of temporal stressors applied to input videos. The library includes five common temporal transformations: Add, Delete, Replace, Reverse, and Shuffle that capture different ways of modifying temporal structure.

## 🤖 VideoLLMs
Currently, VideoSTF supports tests of 10 mainstream VideoLLMs, including seven LLM-centric models and three native multimodal models.

## 🛠️ Environment Setup
Since different VideoLLMs require different versions of packages, such as transformers, we recommend using separate conda environments.

## 🧪 Testing Suites

VideoSTF includes three testing suites. All suites share a common runner interface with the following common parameters.


| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--adapter` | `str` | Model adapter identifier (see supported adapters below). |
| `--input_folder` | `str` | Path to the input videos directory. |
| `--output_folder` | `str` | Output folder name. |
| `--max_frames_num` | `int` | Number of frames sampled per video. |
| `--temperature` | `float` | Decoding temperature. Set to `0.0` for deterministic generation. |
| `--gpu` | `str` | GPU index. |
| `--cache_dir` | `str` | Cache directory to save model weights and processor. |

**Supported adapters:** `llava_video_7b_qwen2`, `llava_video_7b_qwen2_video_only`, `llava_next_video_7b`, `llava_next_video_7b_dpo`, `llava_next_video_32b_qwen`, `videollama2`, `sharegpt4video`, `internvl35_8b`, `qwen3vl_8b`, `molmo2_8b`.

### 📋 1. Pervasive Testing
VideoSTF tests each VideoLLM under varying numbers of sampled frames, treating temporal granularity as a controlled variable to comprehensively study the output repetition under natural inputs.

---

#### 🚀 Quick Start

~~~bash
python -m runners.batch_infer \
  --adapter llava_video_7b_qwen2_video_only \
  --input_folder your/video/path \
  --output_folder infer_7bqwen2videoonly_16 \
  --max_frames_num 16 \
  --temperature 0.0 \
  --gpu 0 \
  --cache_dir your/cache/dir
~~~

---

#### 📦 Outputs
- Outputs are saved as JSON files in `runners/infer_results/infer_7bqwen2videoonly_16/`.
- JSON files record the model output and the results of the three metrics.


### 2. ⏱️ Temporal Stress Testing
VideoSTF tests VideoLLMs under temporal stressors by applying controlled temporal transformations that preserve semantic content while perturbing temporal structure.

---

#### 🚀 Quick Start

~~~bash
python -m runners.batch_test \
  --adapter llava_video_7b_qwen2_video_only \
  --input_folder your/video/path \
  --output_folder test_7bqwen2videoonly_16 \
  --max_frames_num 16 \
  --temperature 0.0 \
  --gpu 0 \
  --cache_dir your/cache/dir
~~~

---

#### 📦 Outputs
- Outputs are saved as JSON files and CSV files in `runners/test_results/test_7bqwen2videoonly_16/`.
- JSON files record the model output.
- CSV files record the results of the three metrics under different temporal stressors.

### 3. 🎯 Adversarial Exploitation
VideoSTF evaluates whether temporal stressors can be exploited to induce repetition for those videos with normal outputs in a black-box adversarial setting.

---

#### 🚀 Quick Start

~~~bash
python -m runners.batch_attack \
  --adapter llava_video_7b_qwen2_video_only \
  --input_folder your/video/path \
  --output_folder attack_7bqwen2videoonly_16 \
  --max_frames_num 16 \
  --temperature 0.0 \
  --gpu 0 \
  --cache_dir your/cache/dir
~~~

---

#### 📦 Outputs
- Outputs are saved as JSON files and CSV files in `runners/attack_results/attack_7bqwen2videoonly_16/`.
- JSON files contain model generations.
- CSV files record whether the attack succeeds under the temporal stressors and the number of queries required.
